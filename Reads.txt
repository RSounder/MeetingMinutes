My Minutes App;
Rotaract Club of Coimbatore Spectrum hosts several meetings per month and it takes quite an amount of human efforts to log the minutes, format it and proof-read. 
These are intended to be automated by a combination of Google-Speech2Text API from speech recognition and manual (electronic) transcribing added with a dose of GUI using pySimpleGUI to make a light weight desktop application that transcribes and stores the data in a .txt file which is formatted and converted to pdf.
